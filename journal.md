# Introduction
BBOA are important for the radiative effect
but the magnitude and even direction are unclear
see Haywood et al (Haywood 200).
Our measurements set out to add this
body of knowledge using Mass Spectrometer data
(Allan et all 2001).

# Simulations
John's box model is consistant with coagulation
as the dominant growth mechanism.

# Methodology
We used a ToF-AMS to measure aerosol mass and composition
(Smith et al 2001).

# Results
We report change in compostion with atmospheric age.
This is directly linked to the scattering properties
of the particles.

# Figures
This is a draft so the figures go in their own section.

# Appendix
Non-essential, some people have this removed.

# Conclusions
We did some science and it was great. More science
needs to happen, so funding should be applied for.
