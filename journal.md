# Introduction
BBOA are important for the radiative effect
but the magnitude and even direction are unclear
see Haywood et al (Haywood 200).
Our measurements set out to add this
body of knowledge using Mass Spectrometer data
(Allan et all 2001).

# Simulations
John's box model is consistant with coagulation
as the dominant growth mechanism.

# Methodology
We used a ToF-AMS to measure aerosol mass and composition
(Smith et al 2001).
